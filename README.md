# Introduction
For this project I wanted to explore Tennessee population data and Tennessee income data to see what insights I could find.

Data Sources: <br/>[Tennessee Population Data](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html#par_textimage)<br/>
[Tennessee Income Data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=income&g=0400000US47,47.050000&y=2019&tid=ACSST1Y2019.S1901&hidePreview=true&moe=false)

# Python Walkthrough

1. For the first step I installed all the packages required for the project, along with reading in the shp and csv files.

2. In the second step I checked the shape of the dataset along with looking at the head and tail to see the data structure I'm working with. It appears that the rows and columns aren't in the best order.

3. For the third step, I saw that there were rows I didn't need along with text in the columns that was unecessary so I removed both rows and the text.

4. The income dataset came with a full column with Tennessee income data, but for my use case I wanted the whole dataset to be county specific. I then filtered out the columns mentioned along with checking the county income filtered dataframe's info to see what datatypes the columns were.
